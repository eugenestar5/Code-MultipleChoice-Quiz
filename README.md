## Multiple Choice Coding Quiz

This web application helps users to test their knowledge in JavaScript concepts. 
It is designed in a multiple choice question format where the user answer series of questions and get a score in the end. The project has contributed a lot to my coding mindset interms of logic and meeting the requirements.
